# piQture: Demos and Tutorials
A collection of demos and tutorials using `piQture` and `Qiskit`.

## Getting Started

### Setup


Begin by creating a new Python environment or activating an existing one for working with the `piQture` library. You set up a Python virtual environment `venv` or a Conda environment and use `pip` or `conda` to install the `piQture` package.

Here's how you can create a conda environment and manage a Python environment:

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n piqture_env python=3.x

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate piqture_env
```

### Installation

Once the Python environment is activated, the required `piQture` package can be installed using `pip`. You can install the latest version directly from PyPI.

```bash
pip install piqture
```
